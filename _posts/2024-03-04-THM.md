## What is TryHackMe?
TryHackMe is an online learning platform for cybersecurity through a mix of theory and practical labs, given through virtual machines that the platform provides.

## My learning on TryHackMe
As of the 4th of March, I am on a 78 day streak of learning on the platform. It has really helped to introduce me to some of the tools used in the industry, and also works to increase my knowledge of Linux, Networking, Windows etc.

In my blog, I will occasionally put write-ups of rooms that I have completed, as a way to reinforce my new knowledge and ensure I understand my own methods when learning.
